    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Bún bò Huế is a hidden Vietnamese gem that has yet to “make it” in mainstream American cuisine. It's a rich and spicy soup with deep layers of flavor. This Central Vietnamese soup is paired with tender slices of beef and pork, then topped with lots of fresh herbs.</p>
    <p>I consulted my favorite Vietnamese cook-Mom-on how to make bún bò Huế. And to find out subleties that make BBH authentic. I promise you'll love this version!</p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Clean the meat. Put the pork leg, beef shank, and beef chuck into a big soup pan and add water until it just covers the meat. Bring it to a boil. Once the water boils, remove it from the heat and pour out the water. Take out all the meat and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add 3 cloves of garlic, 2 tbsp bun bo hue powder, 1 tbsp of shrimp paste and 1 tablespoon of oil to a soup pan. Cook for 30 seconds until fragrant. (You can use the same one you used to parboil the meat to save time.) Add in the beef shank and beef chuck, and cook until the beef is brown on all sides.</li>
        <li>Add in water until it just covers the meat. I added 3 quarts or 12 cups of water. Bring to a boil, and scoop away any impurities that you see.</li>
        <li>Lower the heat, and add the pork hocks back to the pot. Also, add 1 onion, 1 daikon, and 2 stalks of lemongrass. Simmer for 2-3 hours.</li>
        <li>After 2 hours, check that the meat is cooked through. Leave them in the broth if they need to be cooked more. Once cooked through, take out the meat. Slice the beef and set aside. The beef is cooked through once it's tender and falls off the bone.</li>
        <li>Add 2 tsp of salt, 2 tbsp of fish sauce, 1 tbsp of sugar, and 1 can of chicken broth to the soup. Simmer the soup for another 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
